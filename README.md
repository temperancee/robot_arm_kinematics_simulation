# Robot Arm Kinematics Simulation

Matplotlib based robot arm kinematics simulation. Allows for control of both the end-effector position and orientation, with updates done via inverse kinematics, and control of individual joint angles, with updates done via forward kinematics.

Multiple arms can be simulated. Currently, only the elbow manipulator (3 revolute joints) works. I am working on the 6DOF (6 revolute joints) and 5DOF (5 revolute joints) arms.

Here is a demonstration of inverse kinematics in action on the elbow manipulator:
